We are grateful for your support.

## Cluster access

!!! Note
    Everyone with CIIRC account can access master node of the cluster via

    service, please send a request ticket through
    [CIIRC HelpDesk](https://helpdesk.ciirc.cvut.cz/).
    

On master node you can look around, explore available sw modules, try
your code etc... If you want perform heavy computing via Slurm (see
below) you have to apply for additional permission. Please ask via
helpdesk or mail to it@ciirc.cvut.cz

It is not recommended to run heavy computations on the login / head / master node.
Please use interactive jobs for that.
